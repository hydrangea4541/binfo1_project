Google Colab은 창을 닫은 후 90분 후, 또는 창을 처음 열고 12시간 후에 환경을 닫아버리기 때문에 매번 실습할 때마다 새로 셋업이 필요합니다. `Runtime->Run All`을 실행해서 전체를 한 번 실행하시면 준비됩니다. 모든 것이 잘 안 되고 뭔가 꼬인 느낌이 강하게 들 때는 `Runtime->Factory reset runtime`을 누르고 새로 시작하시면 될 수도 있습니다.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ojAx9SdvPfSz"},"source":["## Google Drive
